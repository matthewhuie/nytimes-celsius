# nytimes-celsius
This is a Chrome extension for converting weather units on NYTimes.com to Celsius. It uses jquery-observe to watch for the weather widget to load in the masthead of the website, then performs unit conversions, string manipulations, and regular expression magic.

## Getting Started
Install the extension via [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nytimes-in-celsius/kolnckgblgehdpcfhhhaldbjhhbckppg)

Or, manually download the packaged extension under Releases, and drag it into Chrome to install.
